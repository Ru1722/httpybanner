# httpybanner
This is a simple web enumeration tool. It is a banner grabber that can do a fingerprint scan, a server scan, or a malformed request scan.

# REQUIREMENTS
Linux (I used Kali Linux)
Netcat (for the malformed packet portion of the code)
Python (2.7)

# UPDATES
I fixed a bug. Instead of the program quitting on invalid input, it will prompt you to select your choice again.

# I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING DONE ILLEGALLY WITH THIS PROGRAM! YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS, NOT ME!
